Hi Team, 

I ran a message trace on both user mailboxes for the past 3 days Please review the below screenshots for emails that were delivered to recipients. 

I have investigate the NDR report and found that below details for the Recipient not found by Exchange Legacy encapsulated email address lookup in the outlook client. 

Error detected:

DSN generated by: 
QB1PR01MB2451.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM 

Solution : 

To prevent the mail program from using outdated address information, clear the AutoComplete Recipients list in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=389363 > or by performing the following actions: 
· Identify the recipient who did not receive your message by looking at the To and CC information in the Original Message Headers section below. Recipients whose names are followed by a character set beginning with 'IMCEAEX' or 'imceaex' did not receive the message. 
· Click New Mail (in Outlook) or New Email (in Outlook on the web). 
· Start typing in the To recipient's name or email address box, until your name appears in the drop-down list. 
· Use the down arrow and up arrow keys to choose the recipient, and then press the Delete key to remove the entry from the AutoComplete list. 
· Retype in the To recipient's email address box and send the message again.

Hi Karen, 

I ran a message trace again to check if any sender mail "duxfordwarehouse@welchgroup.co.uk" are being blocked or quarantined for our organisation, but could not find any block.

Please review the below screenshots for emails that were delivered to recipients. 

I don't think this is an issue with exchange or office 365 and regarding emails sent to external vendor "duxfordwarehouse@welchgroup.co.uk". I don't have any information since "welchgroup.co.uk" is an external domain. Please you will have to contact their help desk to check if any email being blocked on their servers. 

It means that ''550 5.4.300 Message expired ' - Your message couldn't be delivered. Despite repeated attempts to contact the recipient's email system it didn't respond.
Contact the recipient by some other means (by phone, for example) and ask them to tell their email admin that it appears that their email system isn't accepting connection requests from your email system. Give them the error details shown below. It's likely that the recipient's email admin is the only one who can fix this problem.

Thanks, 
Nirmal kumar.S

Hi Mellodie,

Why we are blocking this if this legit?

As per the Security support team suggested that, There are file types recommended to be blocked at the email gateway and are known to be a source of infection/malicious code.

DETAILS: It is recommended to block executable file types since infection risk is high. It may, for example, trigger malicious code or payload upon file click execution. Furthermore, executable file type attachment is not a good security practice, since these files can be normal attachments in most business industries and risk requires user interaction (e.g. the need to decompress, enabling of macro, or loading of disk image).

Executable files types (e.g. binary, scripts and macro-enabled)
·EXE
·SCR
·VBS
·JS
.XML
.DOCM
·XPS

So Please ask user to use this file format ".DOCX" from Macro.

=======================================================================================================================================================

Please following the below step to add the shared mailbox to the outlook client:
1) Click the File tab > Account Settings > Account Settings.
2) Select user email address in the account list.
3) Click Change > More Settings > Advanced tab > Add.
4) Enter the shared account name and click OK.
5) Click Apply > OK > Next > Finish.
6) The shared mailbox will now automatically display in your Folder pane in Outlook.

Change request for action to take from incoming spam and bulk email from “Delete message” to “Quarantine Message” to the SPAM filter policy.


We see that the Spam policy applied that deletes this kind of messages received to this recipient address “mundipharma.com.cn” from sending External mails.

As per Richard Scarrow approved, We will make changes from “Delete message” to “Quarantine Message” for action to take from incoming spam and bulk email in to the SPAM filter policy. 


Again i will restore the mails as a pst file and will share it you on tomorrow

Okay, I think I found why IE11 installed machine is not updated with PAC. If you try login to agi804 I believe it should show correctly. Can  you try this pls ?

If issue is with IE11 installed machines, then some modification required in US01 GP based on Demetrio’s approval.

PFB, the steps.

1.	Get the cloud mailbox GUID. “Get-Mailbox -Identity MariaPilar.Borja.external@mundipharma-rd.eu | FL *GUI*”
2.	Then check for Litigation Hold status “Get-Mailbox -Identity MariaPilar.Borja.external@mundipharma-rd.eu | FL Li*”
3.	If the Litigation Hold is not true, then run “Set-Mailbox -Identity malta.europe.dd@napp.co.uk -LitigationHoldEnabled $true”
4.	To delete the object in O365 run the below commands one by one.
“Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <UPN of user> -Force”
“Get-MsolUser -ReturnDeletedUsers -UserPrincipalName <UPN of user> | Remove-MsolUser -RemoveFromRecycleBin -Force”
5.	Then create a mailbox in On-Premise and migrate it to cloud.
6.	Then run step 1 to find the GUID of new mailbox migrated to cloud.
7.	Once the mailbox migration is completed, then run below command to restore the email from old mailbox to new mailbox.
“New-MailboxRestoreRequest -Name <Name for Restore> -SourceMailbox "Deleted Mailbox GUID which you took in step 1" -TargetMailbox "GUID of new mailbox" -BadItemLimit 100 -LargeItemLimit 100 -AcceptLargeDataLoss -AllowLegacyDNMismatch”
8.	Once the restore completed, then you can remove the litigation hold of an inactive mailbox (Old Mailbox) by running below command.
“Set-Mailbox -InactiveMailbox -Identity malta.europe.dd@napp.co.uk -LitigationHoldEnabled $False”

People invited were part of the group FR-All French Sales People.
The 4 people (Caroli, Millot, Devillers, Boubeker) were in this group before they left Mundipharma one year ago. However they don’t appear in that group now.

I did a training this week and wanted to trace who attended the session. However, some people (Sophie Millot, Chaymaa Boubekeur, Eric Caroli et Karine Devillers who left the company a long time ago : more than 1 year for some of them) appeared on the MS Teams traceability (not invited of course), as you can see on the screenshot. They appeared as “has joined the meeting”, that is really strange.
